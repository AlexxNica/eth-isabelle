# Formalization of Ethereum Virtual Machine in Isabelle/HOL

The status is very immature.  Currently [a Coq project](https://github.com/pirapira/evmverif) about EVM bytecode verification is being ported here.  The directory also contains

* a Keccak-256 implementation in Isabelle/HOL `KEC.thy`
* a RLP implementation (in progress) `RLP.thy`


When you see `\<Rightarrow>` in the source, try using the Isabelle2016 interface.  There you see `â‡’` instead.
